# Data Science Introduction Labs

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Science Introduction Labs repository! This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for various data science labs and exercises completed as part of the CMC-13 Introduction to Data Science course. The code and instructions are primarily in Portuguese, reflecting the course language and requirements. Each lab focuses on different aspects of data science, including data preparation, exploratory analysis, machine learning, and model evaluation.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Lab1**: Data Preparation and Decision Trees
- **Lab2**: Exploratory Analysis and Unsupervised Learning
- **Lab3**: Probabilistic Machine Learning
- **Exame**: Final Exam Project on Real Estate Price Prediction

### Lab1: Data Preparation and Decision Trees

**Objective**: To exercise and solidify knowledge on data preparation, creation of models, and performance evaluation using a provided dataset. 

**Tasks**:
1. Data Preparation: Assess and clean the dataset.
2. Exploratory Analysis: Visualize data using various plots.
3. Model Creation: Implement Decision Trees or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
4. Baseline Classifier: Create a zero-rule classifier.
5. Model Evaluation: Compare models using appropriate performance metrics.

### Lab2: Exploratory Analysis and Unsupervised Learning

**Objective**: To exercise and solidify knowledge on data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and unsupervised learning using a provided dataset of bird bone measurements.

**Tasks**:
1. Data Preparation: Clean and prepare the dataset.
2. Exploratory Analysis: Plot scatter plots and histograms.
3. Unsupervised Learning: Cluster data using K-means and evaluate cluster quality.

### Lab3: Probabilistic Machine Learning

**Objective**: To exercise and solidify knowledge on probabilistic machine learning using a dataset of US congressional votes.

**Tasks**:
1. Probabilistic Model: Create a Naive Bayes or Bayesian Network model to predict political affiliation.
2. Ranking Creation: Generate a ranking of individuals by the probability of being Republican.

### Exame: Real Estate Price Prediction

**Objective**: To exercise and solidify knowledge on data science by predicting real estate prices in the UK.

**Tasks**:
1. Data Preparation: Clean and split the dataset into training and validation sets.
2. Model Creation: Implement MLP Neural Network and Decision Trees/Random Forests.
3. Model Evaluation: Compare model performance using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R².
4. Prediction Application: Apply the developed model to a new dataset.
